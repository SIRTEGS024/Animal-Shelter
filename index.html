      <p class="fafa"> In AmaZOOnico Wildlife Rescue Centre we believe in second chances for our rescued animals. Often
        the wild
        animals we receive arrive here in very poor condition and require a lot of extra care, sometimes including
        special diets and costly medical treatments. While we try to do everything in our power to rehabilitate them,
        unfortunately some of them are too sick or injured or too humanized to be released into the wild again.

        To give them the best chance of freedom or the most peaceful and comfortable life in captivity as possible, we
        need YOUR help. By adopting one of our animals, you can give them a second chance and we will keep you updated
        regularly about your chosen animal. </p>

              having joined us in June 2021 when she was just 4 months old. Inka was taken from her parents as a baby
              and sadly being kept as a pet; she was very attached to humans which is a bad sign for wild cats. She was
              confiscated by the Ministry of Environment </p>

              popular with the ladies! He used to share a cage with our female toucan Warmi… however with the arrival of
              Isla in 2017, well let’s just say he moved on! He’s a stunning White Throated Toucan,who loves

              the pandemic. As they were homeless we took them in to give them the care they need. We don’t know much
              about their back story, but we do know they are super comfortable and loving with people so it's pretty
              likely they were

              humans from the beginning of her life which makes her super friendly with all of us. Sadly as much as we
              love a friendly face; this unnatural behaviour would put her at risk in the wild so she will stay with us.

              rescued, we think he is now about 15 years old. As he is so used to humans, he is super friendly; however,
              this is also why he cannot be released as he will be at risk of hunting.</p>
