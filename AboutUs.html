            <h1>OUR BEGINNING</h1>
            <p> <b>In Ecuador, It is illegal to have, sell or buy wild animals.</b> The ministry of environment
              confiscate them,
              punish the people and bring the animals to wildlife rescue centers to help the conservation of the species
              and the forests.

              In 1993, Angelika Raimann and Remigio Canelos, a Swiss-Quichua couple, with their friend Christine von
              Steiger, wanted to protect the fauna of the Amazon, so <b> they created an NGO called amaZOOnico,</b> a
              center
              that would receive, rehabilitate, and reintroduce wild animals that had been confiscated from illegal
              trade.

              In order to fulfill the plans for reintroduction it was important to create another project that would be
              exclusively dedicated to the protection of the rainforest itself, working with the community towards a
              common goal of sustainable and practical resource use. Such was the birth of Selva Viva: a large umbrella
              project which would come to include 1750 hectares of protected forest, a trilingual school for the
              neighbouring community and two Eco-lodges (Liana Lodge and Runa Huasi) which promote ecotourism.

            <p> <b>amaZOOnico has become one of the biggest animal rescue centers in Ecuador</b>. One of amaZOOnico's
              strenghts is that our team is made of a mix of the traditional knowledge and wisedom of local people and
              a vast array of perspectives and experiences brougth by people coming from all around the world.

              Within 5 hectares, we rehabilitate animals in order to reintroduce them in their natural habitats, we
              care for more than 400 animals that can't be released back into the wild and we carry out environmental
              activities with visitors.

              For those who can be released to their natural habitats, we rehabilitate them with barely human
              interaction and release them in one of the three release stations within Selva Viva.

              All this reality is possible thanks to our permanent staff, the volunteers from all over the world who
              come to help the animals and all the people who donate to amaZOOnico.<b> Because of you, this world is
                becoming a better place for all the beings on Earth.</b>
